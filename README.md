## 🗂️ Feature Sprint Planning

Implement the MVP’s core features—onboarding, logging, tagging, and PDF export—within a 2-week sprint, deployed on Vercel with secure user data handling.

### 🧱 Epics & Key User Stories

1. **Onboarding & First Use**: “As a new user, I want to sign up and get a tutorial, so I can quickly understand how to log achievements.”
2. **Quick Logging**: “As a user, I want to add an achievement in 1–2 minutes with structured fields.”
3. **Tagging & Filtering**: “As a user, I want to tag entries and filter them later.”
4. **PDF Export**: “As a user, I want to download my accomplishments in a clean PDF.”
5. **Privacy & Security**: “As a user, I want my data to be secure and private.”

### 📋 Task Breakdown 
- Frontend: React form, filters, export button
- Backend: Supabase auth, database schema, row-level security
- PDF: Node service for export, clean formatting
- QA: Test cases for signup, logging, filtering, export, and security

### 🕒 Timeline
